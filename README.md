## Project Status

**Important Note:** The server for this project is permanently down, and as a result, the application is no longer accessible. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide active support or maintain the server infrastructure.

## About the Project

This project was an attempt by 2 college students to make online chess game using Flutter and Firebase. The project was a partial success with just about a basic playable game. However, due to severe time constraints and sheer unfamiliarity with the tools used, the project unfortunately ended up employing several bad practices.
